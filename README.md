## Hi, I'm Himel 👋

I'm a Machine Learning **researcher & engineer** with hands-on experience in areas including—but not limited to—**distributed training, model optimization, human–computer interaction, and LLMs for NLP, smart IoT, and healthcare applications**. 

I enjoy bridging the gap between **theory and systems**, and I thrive on building **scalable frameworks** that tackle real-world problems and drive innovative AI projects.

I'm currently exploring:
- 🤖 LLMs for NLP and generative AI
- 🧿 Digital Twin for real-time heterogeneous IoT and edge intelligence
- ✨ Federated & Split Learning
- ⚙️ System-aware ML optimization
- 📶 Communication-efficient model training on non-IID data 
- 📚 ML in real-world, distributed scenarios
